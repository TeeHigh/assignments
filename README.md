# Week 5 Assignments - Introduction to Git and Github
Frontend Web Development - Repo for Zuri training assignments

Week 5 of Zuri x I4G Cohort 2 Training, we were introduced to Git and Github and then we were instructed to upload all our projects from the training to Github. <br>
It is a good means of backing up one's projects and files for safety and future reference.<br>
I uploaded all my exisiting projects to my week 5 repository.
